In statistics and numerical analysis, there is often need to denote that an approximate value is equal to its true value and an error, often written as a change of variable, such as

*X = x + εₓ*.

I find this cumbersome.

Lately, I've taken to marking the approximate value with a [ring diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(diacritic)), such as

*x&#778; = x + εₓ*.

I think of this as the "observed *x*" but read it as *x*-ring, by analogy with *x*-bar and *x*-hat.

I find this less cumbersome. The symbol *x* is shared, relating the approximate with the actual graphically. It's clear at a glance that a variable contains an error term.

Of course the primary advantage is that you can quickly scribble the ring above existing formulas in handwritten notes rather than having to rewrite everything with new variables.
